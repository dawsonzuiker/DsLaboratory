        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Mario Kart World is the pure evolution of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. It takes
          everything that worked before and pushes the series forward in a way
          that feels more intense, more skill driven, and more exciting without
          losing the charm that defines Mario Kart.

        <h2>Gameplay & Feel</h2>
        <p>
          Mario Kart 8 Deluxe often felt one dimensional in its movement and
          drifting. Mario Kart World completely fixes that. The introduction of
          hop jumping, rail jumping, rail sliding, and wall riding transforms
          how races play out. Movement now feels dynamic and expressive rather
          than locked to the track.
        </p>

        <p>
          These mechanics open the door for creative shortcuts and alternate
          routes on nearly every map. The tracks are clearly designed around
          these systems, encouraging wall riding and rail usage instead of
          punishing experimentation. Every race feels different depending on
          how aggressively you play.
        </p>

        <p>
          New items add to the chaos and fun, including items that can swap your
          character mid race or dramatically shift momentum. The addition of
          Knockout Tour is one of the best new modes in the series. After every
          lap, the lowest placing racers are eliminated, turning each race into
          a high pressure survival challenge.
        </p>

        <p>
          Time trials are incredibly rewarding, and I have spent most of my time
          mastering routes and movement tech. Online races are intense and
          competitive, and the added character skins and outfits give every
          player more individuality. It feels nostalgic while still being a
          massive upgrade.

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
          Mario Kart World is upgraded nostalgia done right. It modernizes the
          series without slowing it down and rewards skill, creativity, and
          mastery. It is the pure evolution of Mario Kart and one of the most
          fun racing games I have ever played.
