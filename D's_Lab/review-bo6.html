        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Call of Duty Black Ops 6 feels like a collection of everything that made
          the Black Ops series great, rebuilt for modern PCs with updated
          movement systems and faster gameplay.
        </p>

        <h2>Gameplay & Feel</h2>
        <p>
          The introduction of omni movement completely changes how the game
          feels. Movement is faster, smoother, and more fluid than previous
          entries, making every gunfight feel more dynamic. You can reposition,
          maneuver, and react quicker, which adds a new layer of skill to
          multiplayer.
        </p>

        <p>
          The gunplay feels excellent. Weapons feel punchy and responsive, and
          the grind is extremely satisfying. The camo system is one of the best
          the series has had, and I ended up fully committing to unlocking every
          camo because of how rewarding the progression feels.
        </p>

        <p>
          The game leans heavily into nostalgia in the best way possible. Classic
          maps like Standoff, Raid, and Nuketown return, and they play
          beautifully with the updated movement. On top of that, the
          collaborations bring a fun arcade tone to the experience. Playing as
          celebrities or characters from shows like The Boys adds personality
          without hurting the gameplay.
        </p>

        <p>
          Zombies is a major highlight. It is one of the best Zombies experiences
          in the franchise. Every Easter Egg felt rewarding to complete, and I
          had an amazing time running them with friends. Terminus stands out as
          one of the strongest Zombies maps the series has ever seen, and it is
          still something I go back to regularly.

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
          Black Ops 6 is one of the best modern Call of Duty games. The movement,
          Zombies, map selection, and overall feel make it a standout entry that
          respects the series history while pushing it forward. It is a game I
          continue to come back to and one that feels built for long term play.
