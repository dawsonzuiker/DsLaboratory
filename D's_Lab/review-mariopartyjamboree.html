        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Super Mario Party Jamboree is the magnum opus of Mario Party games. It feels like the
          biggest and most complete version of the formula, packed with content and built to be
          fun with literally anybody.

        <h2>Gameplay & Feel</h2>
        <p>
          The minigame collection is huge, and the game is completely addicting once you start.
          It is the kind of game that works with any group. My girlfriend, my mom, my brother,
          everyone gets into it, and the competitiveness in each match is unmatched.
        </p>

        <p>
          The boards are a major upgrade. They feel lively and interactive, and they are not as
          one dimensional as older Mario Party maps. There are moving paths, moving streets, and
          more going on around you, so matches feel dynamic instead of flat.
        </p>

        <p>
          The character selection is another win. It feels like the biggest roster yet, and it
          adds to the variety when you are playing with a full group. The extra modes are also a
          ton of fun, especially the Jamboree Buddy modes. The Jamboree Buddy is a new piece of
          the game, and it is genuinely fun because it gives you a teammate and a bonus against
          other players, which can swing the whole match.
        </p>

        <p>
          Overall it feels like the most complete Mario Party experience. It is hard to imagine
          a future Mario Party topping this without doing something insane.

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
          Super Mario Party Jamboree is the best Mario Party game to date. The content is massive,
          the boards are more alive than ever, and the new ideas actually add to the fun. If you
          want a party game that always turns into a competitive night, this is it.
