        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Fortnite is the true Battle Royale that owns its own category. No other
          game comes close to it in terms of fun, action, and sheer cultural
          impact. It is not just a game. It is its own universe.

        <h2>Gameplay & Feel</h2>
        <p>
          Fortnite has more collaborations than any game in the history of
          gaming. Every match feels different because you are constantly seeing
          new skins and characters. You could be fighting Peter Griffin, Marge
          Simpson, or even Kim Kardashian, and somehow it all works. That chaos
          is part of the magic.
        </p>

        <p>
          The core gameplay is fast, smooth, and endlessly fun. Playing squads
          with friends is where the game truly shines. A four player squad can
          easily lose track of time, turning a quick session into an all night
          grind without even realizing it.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have been playing Fortnite since 2018, and it has stayed in my
          regular rotation for years. With constant updates, new modes, and
          fresh content, the game never feels stale.

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
          With over 3,500 hours played, Fortnite remains one of the most fun
          multiplayer experiences ever made. It is addicting, endlessly
          replayable, and unmatched in the Battle Royale space. Fortnite is the
          best Battle Royale game of all time.
