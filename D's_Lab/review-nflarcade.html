        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          NFL Arcade is peak arcade sports. It strips football down to pure fun
          and chaos with fast 4v4 gameplay on a shortened field, no first downs,
          and nonstop action.

        <h2>Gameplay & Feel</h2>
        <p>
          The game is built around quick matches, over the top plays, and instant
          excitement. You get four downs to score, abilty using is encouraged,
          and every possession feels important. It is extremely easy to pick up,
          even for people who do not normally play football games.
        </p>

        <p>
          The power ups add just enough chaos to keep every match unpredictable.
          Abilities like speed boosts, slow motion effects, frozen players, and
          score changing events completely flip games on their head and make
          every session feel different.
        </p>

        <p>
          The roster is packed with nostalgic teams and players like Tom Brady,
          Ben Roethlisberger, and Marshawn Lynch on the Bills. Playing against my
          little brother was always a blast, even if I destroyed him every time.

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
          NFL Arcade is the greatest arcade sports game ever made. It is endlessly
          replayable, instantly fun, and perfect for sitting back and having a
          great time with anyone. I keep my Xbox 360 plugged in just for this
          game, and it never gets old.
