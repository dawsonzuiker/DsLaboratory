        <p>
          I’m Dawson. I’m 25 years old and I grew up in Las Vegas, Nevada. My first console was the PlayStation 1, and from there I kept going. My favorite genres are shooter, sports, and racing. The first game I ever played was Crash Bash for the Playstation 1. I frequently make montages of me playing my favorite games on my Youtube Channel!
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ve played on the Xbox Original, Wii, PS1, PS2, Xbox 360, PS4, Xbox Series S, and now PC. I’ve been gaming my entire life, and I’m always down to try new games and see what actually holds up when you put real time into it.

        <h2 class="about-h2">How I Review Games</h2>

        <p>
          My reviews are built around one simple thing: how the game feels when you actually play it. I’m not trying to sound like a critic, and I’m not chasing hype. If it’s fun, it gets credit. If it’s boring, it gets called out.
        </p>

        <p>
          I focus on the parts that matter most to players. How good the gameplay loop is. Whether the game stays fun after the first hour. If the systems feel rewarding or feel like chores. If the movement and controls are smooth. If the game respects your time.
        </p>

        <p>
          I also factor in replayability, community longevity, and value for the price. Some games are amazing once. Some games stay in rotation for years. That matters, and that’s what D’s Laboratory is about.

          <li><strong>Gameplay feel</strong> (movement, controls, pacing)</li>
          <li><strong>Replayability</strong> (does it stay fun)</li>
          <li><strong>Grind and progression</strong> (rewarding or annoying)</li>
          <li><strong>Modes</strong> (multiplayer, co-op, side modes)</li>
          <li><strong>Value</strong> (worth your time and money)</li>
