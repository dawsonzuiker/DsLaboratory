        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is the true compendium of the Mario Kart franchise.
          It brings together decades of tracks, mechanics, and ideas into one
          complete package and stands as the most content rich Mario Kart ever
          released.

        <h2>Gameplay & Feel</h2>
        <p>
          With the Booster Course Pass included, the game features a total of
          96 tracks, the most in Mario Kart history. The DLC adds classic courses
          from Mario Kart Wii, Double Dash, Mario Kart 64, and more, giving the
          game a massive sense of variety and longevity.
        </p>

        <p>
          The customization system adds depth beyond simple character selection.
          Choosing different karts, wheels, and gliders affects handling, speed,
          and weight, letting players fine tune their setup while still keeping
          races accessible and fun. Every race feels a little different depending
          on how you build your kart.
        </p>

        <p>
          The tracks themselves are consistently excellent. Courses like
          Mushroom Gorge, Rainbow Road, and Toad’s Turnpike are visually beautiful
          and feel great to drive. The game strikes a perfect balance between
          party chaos and skill based racing, making it fun for casual players
          and competitive players alike.
        </p>

        <p>
          I fully completed the game, earning three stars on every cup at every
          speed, including mirrored mode. Even after doing everything, it is a
          game I still come back to regularly because it simply never stops
          being fun.

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
          Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is the magnum opus of modern Mario Kart. While it
          does not rely on nostalgia, it delivers unmatched polish, content, and
          replayability. It is the definitive Mario Kart experience and one of
          the best party games ever made.
