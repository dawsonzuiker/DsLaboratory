        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Kirby Air Riders is a fun and chaotic alternative to Mario Kart World.
          It leans more into arcade chaos and personality than strict racing,
          offering a very different experience from traditional kart racers.

        <h2>Gameplay & Feel</h2>
        <p>
          The single player experience is not especially engaging. It feels
          similar to Smash Bros. Ultimate’s single player mode, which never
          really clicked for me. Where the game truly shines is in multiplayer.
          The races are chaotic, surprisingly in depth, and demand constant
          attention.
        </p>

        <p>
          The air rider movement takes time to adjust to. It can feel awkward at
          first, but once it clicks, the gameplay becomes much more enjoyable.
          It ends up feeling like a proper sequel to the original game, which I
          loved growing up. There is a strong sense of nostalgia baked into the
          presentation.
        </p>

        <p>
          The visuals are bright and colorful, the music is excellent, and the
          character variety adds a lot of personality. Even when playing online,
          every match felt different thanks to unique character and kart setups
          from other players. That variety keeps matches feeling fresh.
        </p>

        <p>
          While the game is very fun, it does fall short of Mario Kart World in
          overall polish and consistency. It does not replace it, but it stands
          well on its own as something different.

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
          Kirby Air Riders is a colorful and nostalgic multiplayer focused game
          that works best with friends. While its single player mode is lacking,
          the chaotic races, strong presentation, and variety make it an
          enjoyable arcade style experience.
