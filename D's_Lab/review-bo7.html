        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 continues the franchise’s focus on fast,
          cinematic action, blending familiar mechanics with refined visuals
          and a high-energy presentation.

        <h2>Gameplay & Feel</h2>
        <p>
         One of the biggest strengths of Black Ops 7 is its multiplayer. The map selection is genuinely strong across the board. I enjoyed every map I played, especially Raid, which remains one of my favorites in the series. Hijacked is another standout, and the return of Nuketown feels right at home. These maps flow well and consistently create fun engagements without feeling stale.

The gunplay feels excellent and responsive, and the movement system is a noticeable improvement over Black Ops 6. Wall bouncing in particular feels better tuned and more rewarding, making movement-focused playstyles feel intentional rather than chaotic. Everything feels fast, smooth, and satisfying without becoming overwhelming.

The camo grind is another highlight. Unlocking weapon camos feels rewarding, especially with the Zombies camo skins. The progression system kept me motivated to keep playing and experimenting with different weapons. The variety of killstreaks also adds a lot of personality to matches. One of my favorites is the D.A.W.G. killstreak, which feels both fun and chaotic in the best way.

Zombies is easily one of the most enjoyable parts of the game. The main map is deep and well designed, with plenty to explore. Hunting for the Easter egg and working toward completing the mission is genuinely fun and feels rewarding, especially when playing with friends. It strikes a good balance between challenge and accessibility.

I also spent a lot of time with the co op campaign endgame mode, which ended up being more fun than I expected. The open structure lets you complete missions at your own pace while upgrading your weapons, abilities, and character. It feels more like an open world experience and adds a surprising amount of replay value.

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
         At this point I am Prestige 5, and I can honestly say I am addicted. Between multiplayer, Zombies, and the endgame content, Black Ops 7 keeps giving me reasons to come back. It refines what works, respects the series history, and delivers a gameplay loop that is hard to put down.
