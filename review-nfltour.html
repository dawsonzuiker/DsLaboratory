        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          NFL Tour is the definition of arcade sports. It is loud, fast, and built
          to be fun first. It does not try to simulate real football. It is about
          big hits, quick games, and replaying matches over and over without getting bored.
        </p>

        <h2>Gameplay & Feel</h2>
        <p>
          The single player mode is a blast because the rules get weird in the best way.
          Stuff like fifth down or 20 yard first downs makes every game feel different and
          keeps it from turning into the same drive over and over.
        </p>

        <p>
          The nostalgia is a huge part of why this game hits. Seeing classic teams like the
          old school Tom Brady Patriots or the Ben Roethlisberger Steelers makes it feel like
          a time capsule. It is one of those games you can boot up and instantly get that
          throwback energy.
        </p>

        <p>
          There is a ton of replayability too. The wall jump mechanic adds extra movement and
          style, and there are so many plays to pick from that you can keep mixing things up.
          My favorite way to play is against my little brother. I honestly destroy him every time,
          but it makes the game even better.
        </p>

        <p>
          Overall it is one of the best arcade football games ever, and honestly one of the best
          arcade sports games period.

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
          NFL Tour is pure arcade football and it still holds up because it knows exactly what it is.
          It is easy to pick up, fun to replay, and perfect for quick sessions with friends or family.
          If you miss classic arcade sports games, this is one of the best.
