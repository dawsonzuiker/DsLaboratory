        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          ARC Raiders feels like a mashup of games that already exist, without
          really bringing anything new to the table. It comes across as a mix of
          Escape from Tarkov, Fortnite, Apex Legends, and Destiny, but without the
          personality or polish that makes those games stand out.

        <h2>Gameplay & Feel</h2>
        <p>
          The movement is clunky and slow, which immediately pulled me out of the
          experience. Nothing about the controls felt smooth or exciting, and the
          pacing never really picked up. It feels more confusing than engaging,
          especially early on.
        </p>

        <p>
          I personally prefer shooters that are quick, fast, and fun, and ARC Raiders
          just does not hit that mark for me. The gameplay loop did not hook me, and
          it never reached a point where I felt excited to jump back in.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is not a game I see fitting into my regular rotation. It feels more
          like something you try once out of curiosity and then move on from. I
          did not even buy the game myself. I played it on my brother’s PS5, and
          I am glad I did not spend the full price on it.

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
          ARC Raiders is not a bad game, but it is not for me. It feels slow, bland,
          and uninspired compared to other shooters in the same space. If you enjoy
          slower, more methodical extraction style games, you might get something
          out of it. For me, it is a try it and forget it type of experience.
