        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is the peak of the Smash franchise. It brings back every character in series history and builds the most complete roster and package the series has ever had.

        <h2>Gameplay & Feel</h2>
        <p>
          The roster is stacked with returning legends and huge DLC additions that feel like true crossover events. Characters like Steve and Sora change how matches play and keep the game feeling fresh even years later.
        </p>

        <p>
          The balance is strong for a roster this massive. There is no single “auto win” character across the board, and most matchups feel playable and fair. Steve is the one exception, but outside of that, the game does a great job of keeping the cast competitive.
        </p>

        <p>
          Stages and music are on another level. The visuals are clean, the frame rate stays steady, and the presentation is consistently polished. I have over 2,000 hours in the game and it still feels like something I can boot up at any time and instantly have fun with.

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
          Ultimate feels like the definitive Smash collection and one of Nintendo’s best all time releases. The content, polish, and replay value are insane, and I’m nowhere near done with it.
