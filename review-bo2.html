        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Black Ops 2 is one of the most perfect Call of Duty games ever made, only
          sitting behind Modern Warfare 2 for me. It pushed the series forward with
          new ideas, stronger variety, and a grind that actually made you want to
          keep playing.
        </p>

        <h2>Gameplay & Feel</h2>
        <p>
          A huge part of what makes Black Ops 2 special is how much it added to the
          formula. The multiplayer has some of the best maps in the franchise. Standoff,
          Studio, and Nuketown are all-time classics and they play perfectly. It is the
          kind of map pool that makes you want to run it back nonstop.
        </p>

        <p>
          The camo system was another game changer. Going for Gold and Diamond was
          a completely new kind of grind and it made people care about progression in a
          way the series had not really nailed before. It gave matches purpose even when
          you were not chasing wins.
        </p>

        <p>
          Zombies is also an all timer. Black Ops 2 has one of the best Zombies experiences
          ever and the Easter eggs across the maps are a big reason why. There are a ton of
          maps and they all feel like their own world. Buried is my favorite. The vibe of
          that map is perfect, from going through different levels to the witch’s house,
          and the old saloon. It is pure fun and it never gets old.
        </p>

        <p>
          The only reason it sits slightly under Modern Warfare 2 for me is nostalgia. MW2
          hits deeper, but it is a close call. Black Ops 2 is still the second best Call of Duty
          of all time.

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
          Black Ops 2 is a complete package. Legendary multiplayer maps, a grind that changed
          the series, and Zombies that is still worth playing today. It is right under MW2 for
          me, and that is only because MW2 nostalgia is unbeatable.
