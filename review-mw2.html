        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 is the epitome of arcade shooters. It is the greatest arcade shooter to ever grace this earth. It is the true magnum opus of the Call of Duty franchise and it feels unbelievably perfect.

        <h2>Gameplay & Feel</h2>
        <p>
          Every mode is packed with replayability. The campaign is still the best Call of Duty campaign to this day. It is the standard. Special Ops is also a huge part of what makes the game legendary because you can run co op missions with friends online or in person and it never feels like filler.
        </p>

        <p>
          Multiplayer is infinitely replayable. The maps are iconic, the guns are iconic, and even the sounds and graphics feel burned into gaming history. It has that perfect arcade pacing where everything is fast, loud, and addictive without feeling messy.
        </p>

        <p>
          The killstreaks are a huge reason why MW2 is special. The stacking system is the best example of pure chaos done right. You can go attack helicopter into AC 130 into nuke because killstreak kills count toward your next streaks. That is only done like this in MW2 and it is a big reason why getting hot in a lobby feels so electric.
        </p>

        <p>
          And the nuke is one of the greatest moments in multiplayer history. Dropping a nuke is a complete beautiful moment when it happens. It is the ultimate reward and it never gets old.

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
          This is one of the best games of all time. Actually the best game of all time. Number one all time. MW2 is the definition of arcade shooter perfection and it is hard to imagine anything ever topping the way this game feels at its peak.
